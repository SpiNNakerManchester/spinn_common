 *  \brief Pseudo-random number generators
 *  \author Michael Hopkins
 *  \date February 2014
 *
 * \details
 * These all return well-distributed unsigned 32-bit ints that
 * have been tested rigorously on the DIEHARD, dieharder and TestU01
 * test suites. The Marsaglia KISS generators are slightly faster
 * and the 64-bit one uses the theoretically superior multiplicative
 * algorithm.  The WELL1024a has a cycle length of (2^1024)-1
 *
 * Two versions are available.  A simple version which
 * has a global hidden seed which does not need to be set, and a custom
 * version which allows seeds to be set by the user to either
 *
 * 1. promote independence or
 * 2. guarantee identical behaviour
 *
 * across multiple random number streams.
 *
 * These generators can all be used with the non-uniform RNGs below.
 *
 * \warning
 *     Production code must use the version with explicit seeds to allow for
 *     reproducible random numbers, as this is a critical requirement for
 *     testability and verifiability. Seeds should be supplied from your
 *     Python control code.
