 *  \brief Fast polynomial evaluation, using ARM DSP instructions.
 *
 *    Each function takes three arguments: the polynomial coefficients,
 *    the point at which we are evaluating the polynomial, and the order
 *    of the polynomial.
 *
 *    Assume that we have (note the "reverse order"):
 *
 *        int a [] = { a_4, a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0 };
 *
 *    This represents the function:
 *
 *        a_0 + x * (a_1 + x * (a_2 + x * (a_3 + x * a_4)))
 *
 *    To use the fast DSP instructions we use an "odd" representation
 *    of x: s0.16. If we are using the usual s0.15 fract type, then
 *    we are restricted to x lying in the range [0.5, 0.5).
 *
 *    In the above example (because we have a quartic polynomial) n = 4.
 *
 *    The other point to note is that the addition in the evaluation
 *    may overflow. In the code that follows, we use the Q-bit to
 *    detect if this has happened. One sure-fire case in which there
 *    is no overflow is if the polynomial is alternating.
